Dog Class – Object-Oriented Programming Project

This project defines a Dog class that models a dog object with detailed attributes and behaviors. It also references an accompanying Owner class that represents the dog's owner. This code is designed to demonstrate core OOP principles in Java, including:

Encapsulation

Constructor overloading

Object composition

Getters and setters

Behavior methods

Overriding toString()

Features

The Dog class includes the following methods:
